### Works on mobile & pc

- Each turn you must move each shape of one color.
- It wont let you move any other pieces until the turn is over.
- It says the turn number in the top left.
- When you move one of the pieces at the start of a turn, a colored rectangle shows up at the top center of the screen, which shows the color you chose for that turn.
- If you move a green one at the start, the rectangle turns green to remind you.
- Keep in mind you can destroy other pieces just like chess.
- You can move around the camera by clicking and dragging anywhere on the screen and you can also zoom in/ out with, of course, the scroll wheel.
